Ch02 - Ex 2.3
============

**Question**: *The number 12.7 is equal to the fraction 127/10, where the
denominator is a power of ten. Can you express it as a common fraction where
the denominator is a power of two? What about the number 5,5?*

---------------

**Solution**:

First of all, we can notice that the number `12.7` can be represented in a base of `10`. In the given example, we just multiply it by `10`:

    12.7 = (12.7*10)/10 = 12.7

However, it does not works well with any other base, especially when it comes to represent them in a base of `2`. There is no integer value out of a power of two that can represent exactly either the number `12.7` or the number `5.5`.
